# SNIPER GAME DISCORD BOT

This is a bot for a game played on a few UCLA student discord servers. This bot serves the purpose of keeping track of the leaderboard, also as a database exersize for myself.

The game itself involves taking a photo of an unsuspecting player when running across them, without them noticing, and posting said photo in chat to score a point.

Code is currently a work in progress and pretty garbage, use at your own risk. Bot token should be found in the credentials.py file
